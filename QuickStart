1. Install ansible 2.0 or greater and its dependencies on the client machine (e.g. Mac OS X) using pip

sudo easy_install pip 
sudo pip install paramiko PyYAML Jinja2 httplib2 six
sudo pip install ansible
sudo pip install python-novaclient python-neutronclient
sudo pip install netaddr

3. Edit the settings.yaml file and put in your cloud specific settings
    - If you update the machine roles, the playbooks need update

4. Update the hosts file with the inventory and login information for OpenStack nova compute hosts

5. Run setup.sh
This program will invoke the ansible playbooks to 
- Create instances
- Install docker
- Create the server and client certificates
- Setup iptables rules on nova compute hosts
- Setup the kubernetes cluster
- Configure networking
- Generate the client environment for docker and kubectl

6. The kubectl client will be downloaded to the binaries sub-directory 
   Copy it to /usr/local/bin or update the PATH environment variable to invoke the program.

7. The docker host authentication files for each node will be created in the directory
in which the script runs and will be named as <nodename>.env. To use the docker client against, 
a docker host source the file.
for e.g. 
source master1-k8s.env
docker ps

8. The kubectl config file will be copied to the $HOME/.kube/config location to enable 
secure connectivity between the client and kube-api server.
