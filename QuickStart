1. Install ansible 2.0 or greater and its dependencies on the client machine (e.g. Mac OS X) using pip

sudo easy_install pip 
sudo pip install paramiko PyYAML Jinja2 httplib2 six
sudo pip install ansible
sudo pip install python-novaclient python-neutronclient
sudo pip install netaddr

2. Clone this repo to your local machine

3. Edit the settings.yaml file and add your cloud specific settings
    - Note: If you update the machine roles, all references to previous roles in playbooks and templates need to be updated with the new role name
    - Set the kubernetes version in the "k8s_version" key 
    - Set your openstack ssh key in the os_cloud_profile
    - Configure the instance security group to permit the below traffic from client IPS
         - Kubernetes master API ports
         - tcp port 22 ssh traffic
         - traffic to and from the cluster_cidr range
         - tcp port 2376 for docker
         - tcp port 10250 for kubectl logs

4. Update the hosts file with the inventory and login information for OpenStack nova compute hosts
     - To enable ansible to ssh into the openstack hypervisor, copy your ssh public key and append
       it to the $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys file of the "ansible_user" specified in the host file.

5. Run setup.sh
This program will invoke the ansible playbooks to 
- Create instances for running the cluster
- Install the docker binary
- Create server and client certificates for docker and kubernetes
- Download the client certs and kubeconfig to the local machine
- Setup iptables rules on nova compute hosts to permit traffic to the POD networks
- Setup the kubernetes cluster master and worker components
- Configure networking
- Generate the client environment for docker and kubectl
- Validate the cluster

6. The kubectl client will be downloaded to the binaries sub-directory on the client
   Copy it to /usr/local/bin or update the PATH environment variable to invoke the program.

7. The docker host authentication files for each node will be created in the directory
in which the script runs and will be named as <nodename>.env. To use the docker client against, 
a docker host source the file.
for e.g. 
source master1-k8s.env
docker ps

8. The kubectl config file will be copied to the $HOME/.kube/config location to enable 
secure connectivity between the client and kube-api server.
